## Course Description
This is a practical course covering the basics of programming in the R language. The course is intended for beginners with no prior programming experience.

## Learning Objectives
Students will learn fundamental concepts of R programming, including the use of the RStudio IDE, key programming concepts (variables, conditions, loops, functions) as well as how to plan, structure, and debug code. Students will also get an overview of introductory concepts in data science, focused on essentials needed for biology research. Students will learn to use and interpret key functions for data analysis for some of the most commonly used statistical analyses in biology. Students will also learn the basics of data visualisation in R.

### Assessment
Students will be marked based on participation (coming to the exercises, working on them, asking questions) (40%) and on completion of the exercise sheets (links above, submission in OLAT).

### Getting Help
If you are stuck, the first place you should start is by searching R's help files. If this doesn't get you there, I highly recommend [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) as an excellent resource for help with all kinds of code.

It will be tempting to ask ChatGPT for help. I **strongly** advise you resist this temptation. ChatGPT might solve a particular problem for you, but this is only helpful if your only goal is to solve that particular problem. If your goal is to learn to produce your own code in R, you will be much more successful if you come up with the code on your own. ChatGPT also often produces code that is too complex for beginners; it may be confusing and do more than you really need.

### Cheatsheets
These are very useful references that should be helpful during the course (created by the RStudio team and community).

* [Base-R](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/base-r.pdf)
* A denser, more comprehensive [Base R cheatsheet](R_cheat_sheet.pdf) by Tom Short.
* Using [Rstudio](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rstudio-ide.pdf) like a power user.
* [ggplot2](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf) for more effective graphics (auch [auf Deutsch](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/translations/german/data-visualization_de.pdf))
* [Rmarkdown](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rmarkdown.pdf), for creating reports and webpages with R code interleaved. (auch [auf Deutsch](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/translations/german/rmarkdown_de.pdf))

### Additional Resources
There are many great places to learn R, and this course can't cover everything. If you want to go farther, or get a different perspective, here are a few things I recommend:

* [fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) by statistics professor Norm Matloff.
* The e-book [intro2r](https://intro2r.com) by Alex Douglas et al.
* When you get further along, Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) book is excellent.
