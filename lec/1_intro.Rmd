# Course Introduction

---

# Why scientific computing?
- Growth in big data applications, remote sensing, monitoring, sequencing
- Computation enables analyses that were previously impossible (permutation tests, Bayesian statistics, next-gen sequencing)
- Enables the creation by non-artists of **highly effective visualisations**

class: .lt70

- Open-source **domain-specific** language
--

- Scientific computing is built-in
--

- Large number of packages specifically oriented around statistics, data science, visualisation
--

- Standard language for statistics, and (to a lesser extent) bioinformatics
--

- Excellent tools for scientific communication
	- *Rmarkdown* for websites, reports, presentations
	- *Shiny* for webapps

# Course objectives

- Who this course is for (beginners, people who want to brush up on skills)
- What this course covers (programming concepts, how to use R to accomplish general tasks, basics of data science and scientific workflows, visualisation)
- What it does not cover (statistical theory, advanced programming topics)


---
# Course Format

- Grading, etc
	- Participation in class, working on Ã¼bungen
	- Weekly submission of a group report on the exercises
- Brief lectures to introduce general concepts (hopefully around 1 hour per session)
- Structured exercises to get you coding in R
---

# Resources & Materials
- Course web page
- Recommended reading (web and physical books)
- Getting help: stackoverflow.com, R help files, avoid chatGPT.
- Advanced resoures: R4DS, Advanced R
- You will need
- (recommended): your own laptop (you can also use university computers)
- Please expect to work at least 1 hour outside of class for each hour in class
